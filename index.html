    •	The Interagency GPS Executive Board (IGEB) was an agency of the United States federal government that sought to integrate the needs and desires of various governmental agencies into formal Global Positioning System Planning.

        •	GPS was administered by the Department of Defense, but had grown to service a wide variety of constituents.

            •	The majority of GPS uses are now non-military, so this board was fundamental in ensuring the needs of non-military users.

        The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS, is a radio navigation
satellite system owned by the United States government and operated by the United
States Space Forces.

        <h3></h3>
        <p>
            It is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that provides geographic position
            and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near Earth where there is an
            unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
                There are obstacles such as mountains. Buildings block relatively weak GPS signals
